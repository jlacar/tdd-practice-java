# TDD Practice with Java and JUnit 5

This repository contains exercises you can use to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Java.

Each folder in the root of the repository is a separate starter project. 

After cloning this repo, create a branch for your own practice session. 

Since they are not meant to be full solutions, the starter projects in the main branch will only
be updated to improve their descriptions, add initial files, and update the initial configuration 
to make each project ready to be worked on out of the box.

Each starter project will have its own README file to explain what the exercise is about.

## No Tests Found error with IntelliJ IDEA

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA and created a project from these sources, you might get a "No Tests Found" error 
when you try to run the provided tests. Check the following:

1. Your project Java Language level is correctly set
2. Your project Module content roots are correctly configured. The project content root should have the Source and Test folders configured. Delete any content roots that IDEA created under main and test.
