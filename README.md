# TDD Practice with Java and JUnit 5

This repository contains exercises you can use to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Java.

Each folder in the root of the repository is a separate starter project. 

After cloning this repo, create a branch for your own practice session. 

Since they are not meant to be full solutions, the starter projects in the main branch will only
be updated to improve their descriptions, add initial files, and update the initial configuration 
to make each project ready to be worked on out of the box.

Each starter project will have its own README file to explain what the exercise is about.
