# TDD Practice with Java and JUnit 5

This repository contains exercises you can use to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Java.

Each folder in the root of the repository will be a separate starter project. 

After cloning this repo, create a branch for your own practice session. 

Since they are not meant to be full solutions, updates to the starter projects in the main branch will only
be to clarify or add to their descriptions, initial files, or additional configurations to make each project
ready to be worked on out of the box.

Each starter project will have its own README to explain what the exercise is about.
